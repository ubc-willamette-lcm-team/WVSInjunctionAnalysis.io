# Background 

Rotary screw traps (RSTs) are used to monitor downstream migration of salmonids throughout the Willamette Valley basin. 
The locations of the RSTs are in a previous sheet; this sheet shows when the RSTs were actively sampling (according to dates in cleaned RST records).

# RST on/off times

```{r map-it, echo = F, message = F, warning = F, out.width = "100%", out.height = "100%"}
setwd("C:/Users/mdeith/OneDrive - UBC/General/Injunction Analysis/")
setwd("injunction_timeline/code/WVSInjunctionAnalysis.io")

# Uses the outputs from the "add_rst_to_basemaps.R" script in the "supp_code" folder of the website page

library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

rst_onoff_df <- readRDS("data/2024_07_23_RST_OnlinePlot.Rds")

rst_onoff_df %>%
  plotly::layout(
    legend = list(
        x = 0, 
        y = 1, 
      orientation = 'h', 
      font = list(size = 12)),
      autosize = T, height = 800, width = "100%")
