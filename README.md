# About this repository

This is a repo to host various interactive graphics that UBC is using to help assess the impacts of WVS Injunction Measures.
For full descriptions of the WVS measures, see the [WV Project Injunction webpage](https://www.nwp.usace.army.mil/Locations/Willamette-Valley/Injunction/).

Interactive graphics created by UBC include: 
* An timeline of project-by-project implementation measures, arranged by sub-basin. The timeline shows when different measures were implemented at which times, and shows instances where the measures had to be bypassed due to, e.g., flood risk mitigation. 
* An interactive map of rotary screw trap (RST) locations, showing the locations of the traps at each project of interest. By hovering over the map, you can see years in which each trap was active during pre- and post-injunction periods.
